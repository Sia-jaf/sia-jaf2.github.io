# About me
I am mathematician.

I recently graduated from the phd math recently working on Low dimensional topology and Khovanov homology.

I like to program and stay updated on research side of machine learning. 

I love to read about the recent advancements of topology geometry and math in other sciences. Have you heard about the TDA? How about KDA?
